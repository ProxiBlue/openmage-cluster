# Auto-Scalable OpenMage Cluster

** Untested in production - use at own risk **

OpenMage, PHP based eCommerce platform, is packaged as an advanced highly reliable and auto-scalable cluster on top of certified Jelastic dockerized stack templates with the following topology:

- **Varnish** load balancer is supplemented with **NGINX** server as HTTPS proxy
- **Scalable NGINX PHP** application servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes
- [**MariaDB Cluster**](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/mysql-cluster) with asynchronous master-slave replication to ensure high availability, fault tolerance and data security
- **Redis Sessions** node to retain user session parameters
- **Redis Cache** node for content cache storing
- [**Elastic Data Storage**](https://docs.jelastic.com/data-storage-container) node for media files
- PHP 7.4
- Lets Encrypt for SSL on default jelastic domain upon install
- Dynamic Admin Url for security

<img src="https://github.com/ProxiBlue/openmage-cluster/blob/main/images/settings.png" width="400">
</p>

* type the *Environment* name, 
* optionally, customize its [Display Name](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-aliases). 
* set the OpenMage Locale, Timezone and Currency

Admin email will be the Jelastic environment owner email

Then, select the preferable [region](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-regions) (if several are available in your jelastic environment) and click on **Install**.
Once the deployment is finished, youâ€™ll see the appropriate success pop-up with access credentials to your administration Magento panel, whilst the same information will be duplicated to your email box.

So now you can just click on the **Open in browser** button within the shown frame and start filling your highly available and reliable Magento installation with the required content, being ready to handle as much users as your service requires.
